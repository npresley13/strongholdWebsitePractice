My website is a simplified version of my companies website strong-hold.com.

CSS Requirements

Throughout the website I use several instances of flexbox and CSS grid. 
If you navigate to the products page, you will see an example of CSS grid 
used to organize my products. 
You will also notice that I use an expandable menu depending on the screen
size that you are viewing the website. 

JavaScript Requirements

If you navigate to "Quote" page, you will notice a form with form validation.
See forms.js to view the code.
The products on the products page is being populate by a JavaScript array.
The menu used is being pulled into the menu by looping through the items 
and displaying them as nav items.
I also have set several variables using const.
Them mobile menu switches between hamburger and times and shows the mobile
menu.

FYI 

- The search bar is for styling and is not functioning
